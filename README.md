Synthetic Sales Data Generator
This project provides a Python-based generator for creating a realistic, synthetic sales dataset for a fictional beverage wholesale company. The data is tailored for use in analytics, pricing strategy development, and machine learning projects. It incorporates key features like customer segmentation (B2B and B2C), regional preferences, and dynamic pricing strategies.

Features
Dynamic Pricing
Adjust prices for seasonal demand (e.g., summer and Christmas peaks).
Incorporate inflation and premium brand pricing adjustments.
B2B and B2C Customer Logic
B2B Customers:
Discounts based on order quantities.
Flexible price ranges for dynamic pricing.
B2C Customers:
Fixed, inflation-adjusted pricing with no discounts.
Regional Preferences
Simulates regional product preferences (e.g., Erdinger Wei√übier is preferred in Bavaria).
Probabilistic product selection based on predefined regional weights.
Multi-Item Orders
Customers can order multiple unique items per transaction, avoiding duplicates within the same order.
